dayplanner
This day planner is for homework 5. The calendar is to save events for each hour using J-query and moment.js for time.
Current day and time is to be displayed at the top of page and below a list of time blocks that are color coded for past,present and future. When a time block is clicked then event can be entered and saved to local storage.
However when submitting , I noticed the time was no longer correct with the date. It was correct previous. I searched for other cdns and all had the same issue for me.
